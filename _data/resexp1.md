- Solved dynamic optimization problem based on direct collocation methods in Julia to find optimal trajectory.
- Minimized integrated residuals lower to 1e-6 with mesh refinement methods, Minimax Error, Bisection, etc. 
- Provided novel methods, warm start and early termination, reducing algorithm running time up to 40%.
